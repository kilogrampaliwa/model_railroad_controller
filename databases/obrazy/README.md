# Obrazy README

The **images** folder contains files in PNG and JPG formats used in the layout created with the Tkinter library. It is divided into two subfolders: **nst** and **static**.

## Folder Structure

### static

The **static** folder contains large, unchanging background images such as maps or layouts. These images serve as the backdrop for other elements that appear during the process. Objects in this folder remain constant throughout the operation.

### nst

The **nst** folder contains dynamic images that are displayed only after a specific function is triggered. Most images in this folder are grouped by color variations or symbolic versions, which are displayed depending on the current state of an object.

#### Subfolders in nst:

- **fun**: Functional images that can act as buttons (an old concept).
- **kom**: Predefined templates for pop-up windows.
- **num**: Numbers on a black background, intended for action-counting functionality.
- **odc**: Color-coded sections representing track segments, corresponding to the tracks on the layout and in reality.
- **prz**: Buttons displayed on the layout.
- **sem**: Semaphore images in various color schemes and arrangements.
- **wyk**: Symbols representing derailers (an outdated concept).
- **zwr**: Symbols for switches and crossovers, with many different versions.

## Purpose

The **images** folder plays a crucial role in visualizing both static and dynamic elements on the layout. The **static** subfolder provides foundational images for the layout, while the **nst** subfolder enables dynamic interactivity by visually representing different states and objects.

This organized structure ensures a clear distinction between constant and variable elements, making it easier to manage and expand the visual components of the layout.
